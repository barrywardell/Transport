Numerical code for integrating the transport equation for V0 along a geodesic
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

===========
Version 0.9

The latest version of this code will always be available on the project
website:

Compiling
---------
This code requires the GNU Scientific Library 
(http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/). Make sure it is installed before 
proceeding further.

Compiling should be as simple as extracting the files to a folder and running
'make'. This will then create four executables, for calculating the square root
of the Van Vleck determinant and V0 in Schwarzschild and Nariai spacetimes.

Usage
-----
The code requires the following command line parameters:

tau1:		The affine time to integrate up to
r0:		Initial radial location
r_deriv_0:	Initial radial velocity
m:		Black hole mass
e:		'Energy' constant of the motion
l:		'Angular momentum' constant of the motion
type:		Type of geodesic - 0=null, -1=timelike, 1=spacelike
xi:		Coupling to the scalar curvature.


For example, for a circular geodesic at r=10M in Schwarzschild, this would be:

./V0Schw 100.0 10.0 0.0 1.0 0.956183 3.77964 -1.0 0.0
